<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li> ARBs</li><li>ACE Inhibitors</li><li>Renin Inhibitors </li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) inhibitor market consists of three main types: Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs), ACE Inhibitors, and Renin Inhibitors. ARBs block the action of angiotensin II, reducing blood pressure and offering cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, also lowering blood pressure and promoting heart health. Renin Inhibitors target the enzyme renin to decrease angiotensin production, offering a different mechanism for hypertension management. Each type addresses hypertension and related cardiovascular disorders.</p></p>
