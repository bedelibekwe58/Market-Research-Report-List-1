<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hollow Core Mid-infrared Optical Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photonic Bandgap Fiber</li><li>Inhibited-Coupling Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hollow core mid-infrared optical fiber market primarily includes two types: photonic bandgap fiber and inhibited-coupling fiber. Photonic bandgap fiber utilizes a periodic microstructure to trap light within the fiber's core using photonic bandgap effects, enabling low-loss transmission over mid-infrared wavelengths. Inhibited-coupling fiber, on the other hand, employs a design that minimizes the coupling of light to the surrounding cladding, enhancing light confinement and transmission efficiency. Both types are crucial for applications in sensing, telecommunications, and material processing.</p></p>
